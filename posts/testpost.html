    Continuing our start-of-semester game jam tradition, Hoosier Games kicked off the new year with a flurry of hectic game development.
    Jam participants were tasked with putting together a game based on a <a href="https://videogamena.me/" target="_blank">randomly generated title</a> in just 150 minutes.
    The results of these efforts are showcased below!

    <em>Def Jam Disco in Crazyland</em> is a constantly rotating, keyboard-based rhythm game that is much harder than it has any right to be.
    Try and keep your score in the positives as more and more key orbs start flying your way! Download the game <a href="./archives/DJDICL-HG2018.zip" target="_blank">here</a>
