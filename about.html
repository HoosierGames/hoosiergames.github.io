            <strong class="big-text">The General Forum</strong> offers a no-commitment environment where members can
            practice their personal personal skills.
            The Forum is simply an open space where people can work on personal projects, bounce ideas off
            others, showcase their creations, or learn from member-led workshops, all without the stress of deadlines or other
            commitments. For everyone from the beginner developer to the seasoned veteran, our goal is to make The Forum a weekly event to look forward to.
            <br /><br /><br />

            <strong class="big-text">Specialist Teams</strong> are
            the perfect way for those interested in a particular area to hone their skills and build a portfolio.
            These teams work for just four weeks on a specific project that targets a certain development role,
            from programming to art and everything in between. While the workload may be heavier than what you would
            find in the General Forum, the goal of these teams is to produce showcase-ready work that highlights
            your specific skills as a game developer.

            <strong class="big-text">Production Teams</strong> give members who are serious about working in the industry the opportunity
            to use their skills in a collaborative environment. These teams are comprised of members in various roles
            who set out to design, prototype, and eventually release a full game. These teams are not
            for beginners, as regular deadlines and progress reports are expected. In addition to this,
            developing a full blown game is not an easy task, so Production Teams might choose to continue
            their  work over the course of multiple semesters. While the commitment is much more intense than
            the General Forum or Specialist Teams, completing a game with a Production Team is hands down the
            best way to show a commitment to working in the industry.
